# 📌 QA Manual Portfolio - Gonzalo Bessone

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my portfolio 😊  
I'm Gonzalo, a QA Manual trainee, and in this repository I share some of the work I’ve been doing while learning how to test software.

You'll find real examples of:

- ✅ Functional test cases
- 🐞 Bug reports
- 📝 Test plans
- 🖼️ Evidence (screenshots, videos, etc.)
- 📚 Useful documentation every QA should know

## 🔍 About Me

I'm starting my journey in the QA world. I'm interested in software quality, functional analysis, and helping teams build better products.  
I'm currently learning how to design test cases, report bugs clearly, and understand testing processes and strategies.

This portfolio is both a way to practice and a space to show what I can do.
